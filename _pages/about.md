Hi there! My name is Kewei Zhang (张可为). I am a fourth-year CS undergraduate student at Wuhan University, under the supervision of Prof. [Zheng Wang](https://wangzwhu.github.io/home/). I am expected to enroll at Peking University in Fall 2026, supervised by Prof. [Daquan Zhou](https://zhoudaquan.github.io/homepage.io/). I am currently a member of [DAGroup](https://github.com/DAGroup-PKU).

My research interests lie in **AIGC**, **dVLM** and **Efficient AI**. Additionally, I am passionate about AI-driven computer applications and have accumulated technical expertise in AI-related software development.
